# JSbmiCalculator

//This code assumes that you have an HTML form with two inputs: "weight" (the weight in kilograms) and "height" (the height in meters). 

//It also assumes that you have two HTML elements with IDs of "result" and "category" that will display the calculated BMI and BMI category, respectively.

//To use this code, you would call the calculateBMI() function whenever the user submits the form. 

//The function gets the user's input values, calculates the BMI, rounds it to two decimal places, displays the BMI, and determines the BMI category based on the BMI value.

//Note that this code is a very basic example of a BMI calculator and doesn't handle all possible edge cases. 

//Depending on your use case, you may need to add additional error handling or validation.
